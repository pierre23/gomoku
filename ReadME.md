Gomoku, also known as five in a row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15×15 of the 19×19 grid intersections. The game is known in several countries under different names.

This program is a Gomoku Narabe game bot, using an algorithm focusing on the performance of its artificial intelligence.

### **Tech**
For this project we've used the following:
  - Python - Programming language
  - Pyinstaller - converter from python to windows executable
  - Piskvork - Gomoku Interface Manager 
  - VirtualBox - Virtual Machine with Windows installed to excecute the program
  
### **Installation**
>The program uses [Piskvork](http://gomocup.org/download-gomocup-manager/).
OBS! You need to be on Windows to run the ai with Piskvork
>

```sh
$ ./compile.py
$ ./pbrain-Paris-Lundh-Sandra.exe
```
